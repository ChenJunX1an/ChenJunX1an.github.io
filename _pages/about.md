Hi! I am Junxian Chen(陈俊先), a recent graduate from Hunan University, where I completed my master's degree under the guidance of *[Prof. Ruihui Li]*(http://csee.hnu.edu.cn/people/liruihui). Before this, I received my B.Eng. Degree from College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, China.
